- [_] Go over aaaall the jsx and make sure it's semantic

- [_] Styling (!!)
  - [x] General layout
  - [x] Style output ([idea](https://www.scribd.com/document/660775539/academic-word-resume-template))
    - [x] Style each individual education/work datapoint
    - [x] Maybe use variables in the output file for font/spacing like we did on [index.css](./src/index.css) cause it's getting pretty messy in that css file
      - [x] whoa I didn't know you could use dir links in markdown
  - [x] Put To/From inputs side by side with a container or smn
  - [_] Tweak dark mode colors
  - [x] Remove unused dependencies and add mdi icons
  - [_] Icons
    - [x] Use mdi icons in add/delete buttons
    - [x] Add mdi icons to output
    - [_] Preprocess email address to include soft breaks
    - [_] See if icons would look good anywhere else (though it looks pretty good as is)
  - [_] Make that sucker responsive

- [_] Optional features (put extra ideas in here)
  - [_] Improve dark mode toggle logic
  - [_] Drag n' drop to change the order of Input Groups
  - [x] Fix: make To: date input min="" equal to From: (a.k.a: make it so you can't have nonsensical dates such as 2025-2018)
  - [x] Fix: Disable To: input unless From: has been set (so you can't have something like "(empty)- 2025")
  - [x] Fix: When first interacting with "From", insert the current year instead of 1900
  - [x] Fix: Update To: when From: is set to a smaller value
  - [x] Make it so, when To: and From: are the same, they output "2023" instead of "2023 - 2023"
  - [x] Make it so empty To: date outputs something like "2023 - Current"
  - [_] Look at (idea) and see if we should add more datapoints
  - [_] Reset whole form
  - [_] Reset section? (debatable)
  - [_] Download as pdf
  - [_] Change output layout (choose between setups)
  - [_] Add photo
  - [_] Dark/light mode
  - [_] Lazy load sections of the page and add loading icon (only if loading times become an issue)

  - [_] Save any résumé to localStorage with a name
  - [_] Save latest version in localStorage anonymously if not named, and load it if it exists

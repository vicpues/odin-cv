- [_] Go over aaaall the jsx and make sure it's semantic

- [_] Styling (!!)
  - [_] Maaaaaybe create a design file in figma
  - [_] General layout (mobile first!)
  - [_] Fix output element jankiness by giving it a totally fixed layout
  - [_] Style components individually
  - [_] Make that sucker responsive

- [_] Optional features (put extra ideas in here)
  - [_] Improve dark mode toggle logic
  - [_] Drag n' drop to change the order of Input Groups
  - [x] Fix: make To: date input min="" equal to From: (a.k.a: make it so you can't have nonsensical dates such as 2025-2018)
  - [x] Fix: Disable To: input unless From: has been set (so you can't have something like "(empty)- 2025")
  - [x] Fix: When first interacting with "From", insert the current year instead of 1900
  - [x] Fix: Update To: when From: is set to a smaller value
  - [x] Make it so, when To: and From: are the same, they output "2023" instead of "2023 - 2023"

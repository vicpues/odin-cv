# Résumez App

A web app to create and edit your own résumé. [Check out the site here!](https://reesumez.netlify.app/)

This was an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application)'s fullstack javascript webdev course.

## How to use

Enter your info in the inputs and the résumé will update automatically. On mobile, you can switch between editing and previewing the résumé with the arrow at the bottom of the screen.

Under "Education" and "Work experience", you can add extra entries with the "+" button, or delete an entry with the "x" button.

## Planned features

If I can be bothered to keep up development, you can expect these major features:

- Download and print your résumé as a PDF
- Save your data so you can continue editing where you last left off
- Reorder your work/education entries by date.
- Extra layouts so you can customize the look of your résumé
- Add photos to your document
- Extra languages
